Building [FocusHub](https://focushub-5sq5.onrender.com/) wasn’t a weekend hack project—it was an end-to-end crash course in designing production-ready web apps with real-time components. From setting up Django Channels to deploying WebSocket-enabled apps on Render, I hit every wall, fought every 403, and learned more in 3 weeks than most textbooks could teach in a semester.

This post walks through what I built, how it works, and what it taught me.

## 🎯 What is FocusHub?

FocusHub is a virtual productivity space where users can:

- Join **real-time study rooms** and chat with others via WebSockets
- Use a **Pomodoro timer** to track sessions
- **Listen to lo-fi music** embedded from curated static tracks
- **Rate their productivity** which is self-explantory through post-session and visuals on user dashboard
- See their **session history**, duration, and notes for additional motivation
- Track **recent study trends** with user-friendly visuals and detailed logs
It’s like a virtual library meets productivity app, designed to help users stay focused and motivated.

## 🔧 Major Features and How They Work

### 💬 Real-Time Study Rooms (with Django Channels + ASGI)

This was my first dive into **ASGI** (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) along with Django to enable WebSockets. Traditional Django (via WSGI/Gunicorn) wouldn't cut it.

- Used **Daphne** instead of Gunicorn to serve the ASGI app
- Implemented **rooms.routing** for WebSocket logic
- Built **chat functionality** using group-based channel layers
- Managed real-time messages with in-memory layers

**What I learned:**  
ASGI requires a different mindset than typical Django—`asgi.py` needs to be set up properly with routing and Channels middleware. Debugging async stack traces was a fun skill level-up.

### ⏲️ Pomodoro Timer & Session Logs

Each user gets:

- A frontend timer
- A backend `StudySession` model storing start and end time
- Auto-calculated durations (with some bugs I had to fix—more below!)

I used Django’s ORM to track session durations and attached them to specific rooms and users.

**What I learned:**  
Handling `duration` properly means converting from `total_seconds()` to minutes—otherwise you end up showing users things like “False min” on the dashboard 😅. Adding a `@property` saved me from dirty math in the template amazing decorators and there is so much to learn.

### 🎵 Lo-fi Music Integration

The app plays lo-fi music via embedded audio players sourced from static `.mp3` files.

Challenges:
- Ensured valid file paths were included in `collectstatic`
- Used **WhiteNoise** for static file handling on Render
- Had to debug a bunch of 404s (static file routing is a pain in prod)

**What I learned:**  
`STATICFILES_DIRS`, `STATIC_ROOT`, and `STATIC_URL` must be configured *exactly right*—and `collectstatic` is non-negotiable.

### 🧠 Gamified Productivity Ratings

- Streak tracking
- A competitive leaderboard shows users’ productivity time based on their Pomodoro sessions.
- Room Recommendations based on session history help users stay in the right mindset.
- Visually appealing cards display session data, including:
- See their **session history**, duration, and notes
- **Track weekly study hours**, session count, and time spent
- View **heatmaps** of study consistency across weekdays/months
- **Maintain streaks** for daily studying
- Climb the leaderboard of **top rooms based on activity**

**What I learned:**  
Subtle UX details like this make a huge difference in engagement, and are surprisingly fun to implement.

### 📊 Recent Sessions Timeline

Each user sees their most recent study logs, including:

- Room title
- Duration

## 🏗️ The Deployment Journey (aka The Struggles)

### 🔄 ASGI, Render, and Gunicorn Errors

I faced every possible misconfiguration:

- **"ModuleNotFoundError: app"** – from Render’s default `gunicorn app:app`
- **Static file 404s** – because I forgot `collectstatic`
- **"web: command not found"** – from putting `web:` inside the `startCommand` block
- **CSRF 403** – solved by adding `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- **"auth_user does not exist"** – because I forgot `python manage.py migrate`
- **No SSH or pre-deploy command on free Render** – so I injected `migrate` and `createsuperuser` directly into `asgi.py` 🤯

**What I learned:**  
Cloud deployment is a tough nut to crack at times, after building your app. Free-tier constraints push you to learn dirty but clever tricks—and I loved every minute of it.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML + TailwindCSS + JS
- **Backend**: Django, Django Channels, PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: ASGI, Daphne, WebSockets
- **Hosting**: Render (free tier!)
- **Extras**: WhiteNoise

## 💡 Final Thoughts

This project made me appreciate how much goes into creating a “simple” product:

- You need **backend logic**, **frontend polish**, **deployment infrastructure**, **security setup**, and **a dev’s curiosity** to keep going when 403s and tracebacks feel never-ending.
